...Introduction....
The project here is an LLM Dashboard. Using it users will be able to select a source, 
ask questions about the soucre, recieve answers, and check chat history.

-------------------------------
....Overall Setup....
Adding this line to show push / pull - BD

Notes for ollama:
Download ollama from site: https://ollama.com/download
If done correctly then inputting 'ollama' into the terminal should print the list of commands for ollama.
In Models choose llava 7b: https://ollama.com/library/llava:7b --> In terminal run: ollama run llava:7b [NOTE: This could take up to around an hour....]

VSCode:
In terminal for vscode write: python3 -m venv venv (this makes the virtual environment) <<<This was already done [do not do this]
To activate: 
    --> Windows: venv\scripts\activate.bat <<<MUST BE DONE TO WORK (puts you in venv)
    --> Mac: source venv/bin/activate <<<MUST BE DONE TO WORK (puts you in venv)
To install streamlit: pip ollama streamlit (may be pip3 ollama streamlit)

Make sure you download python and have the python extensions for VSCode. 
Make sure that you choose the python interpreter (venv one)

Make sure you have pypdf installed.
To do this:
    --> pip install pypdf
    --> pip3 install pypdf (if regular pip is not working)

Also make sure you have Pandas and the docx reader installed.
To do this:
    --> pip install Pandas
    --> pip install tabulate
    --> pip install python-docx
-------------------------------
....Other Notes....

Created Bob.py
Make sure to select python virtual environment, it will be the venv one
Run ollama serve in other terminal to make sure ollama is running. 

To run: in terminal do: streamlit run Bob.py


....Styling within config.toml.....
in terminal: streamlit config show <-- not needed anymore (future reference note)
Then you can navigate to the streamlit config.toml file and open it. (This is now in the streamlit folder that shows on the side)
Make edits within there (be very careful)


-------------------------------
....IMPORTANT....
In order to run at all (for streamlit run Bob.py) you MUST be in the venv. To do that make sure you activate venv [text above for windows or mac]
Don't forget to do ollama serve in normal terminal as well.

-------------------------------

Pyinstaller Information
 To make the executable: (will go in the dist folder) pyinstaller run_Bob.spec 
(This will make the executable in the dist folder)
Troubleshooting for port issue:
In terminal do: lsof -i :8501 
^^(This will show the processes with that port)..... kill them: kill -9 <PID>
Further troubleshooting will be added if this stops working again.
